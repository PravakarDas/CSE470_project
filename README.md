üóíÔ∏è Documentation for Cooking Recipe Website Project



Overview:

This project is a cooking recipe website developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Users can share their recipes with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Additionally, non-users can browse and view all recipes without creating an account.

Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely to access personalized features such as creating, updating, and deleting their recipes.
Recipe Management: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete recipes. Non-authenticated users can only view recipes.
Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories.
Responsive Design: The website is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
Pagination: Recipes are displayed in paginated format to improve website performance and user experience.
Social Sharing: Users can share recipes on social media platforms to engage a wider audience.

Technologies Used

Frontend:
React.js: Used for building the user interface and handling client-side logic.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the website.
Redux (optional): For state management, especially for user authentication and global application state.

Backend:
Node.js: Powers the backend server and handles requests from the client.
Express.js: Used to build the RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
MongoDB: Stores recipe data in a NoSQL database.
